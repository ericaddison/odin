# jQuery Etch-a-Sketch Project

This is the first jQuery project described in the "Odin Project" online web-development course, 
as described [here](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/javascript-and-jquery).

This page displays a square board populated with a grid of `div`s. The `div`s will 
change color on mouse hover according to the selected color at the bottom of the page.

Grid size can be changed by entering a new positive integer (<= 64) in the text input box 
on the bottom of the screen and pressing return. Large numbers will take a moment to process.

A warning message is displayed when the browser window is resized, explaining that the drawing board will
be resized upon the next grid-size change.
